- This is a project where we are recreating a website in html/css/bootstrap based on a provided prototype. In it, we had to both recreate the website in 'pixel perfect' accuracy, as well as make our own adjustments to the website so it would look good on both tablet and mobile format as well. -->
- Peer Review By: Jasmine Leek -- "Ken! Super clean code and site, matches the prototype perfectly. Everything is easy to follow with the comments, including the responsive code. One thing I noticed, you have the hover code of your navbar set to 0.063rem ~1px, the prototype has it set at 2px. I love the little hamster emoji in the Title!"
